Description
-----------
LeetCode Blur is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your problem-solving experience on LeetCode by blurring previously written code solutions. This prevents accidental spoilers, helping you to approach problems with a fresh perspective every time you visit. Ideal for those who want to practice problems multiple times or for educational settings where spoilers can hinder learning.
